## Overview

⚠️ **CONFIDENTIAL - PROPRIETARY SOFTWARE** ⚠️

This repository contains the comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD) for a enterprise-grade Rules Engine system. The PRD follows Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles and provides complete specifications for implementing a high-performance, scalable rules management platform.

**Access to this repository is restricted to authorized personnel only. This software and documentation are proprietary and confidential.**

## 🚀 Features

The Rules Engine supports the following bounded contexts:

- **🎫 Coupons Management**: Coupon creation, validation, and fraud prevention
- **⭐ Loyalty Programs**: Customer tier management and rewards processing  
- **🎯 Promotions**: Campaign management and promotional rule execution
- **💳 Payments**: Payment processing rules and optimization
- **💸 Taxes & Fees**: Multi-jurisdiction tax calculation and compliance
- **⚡ Core Engine**: High-performance rule evaluation and conflict resolution

## 🔧 Technical Highlights

### Domain-Specific Language (DSL)
The project includes a complete DSL specification with ANTLR4 grammar for business rule authoring:

```dsl
IF customer.tier = "GOLD" AND purchase.amount > 100 
THEN discount := 15%
```

### Performance Requirements
- **Response Time**: <500ms for 95% of rule evaluations
- **Throughput**: 1000+ transactions per second sustained
- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime
- **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling support

### Integration Patterns
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Loose coupling between bounded contexts
- **API-First Design**: OpenAPI specifications for all integrations
- **Multi-Channel Support**: Web, mobile, POS, and API interfaces

## 📚 Documentation Standards

This PRD follows comprehensive documentation standards:

- ✅ **Complete Feature Coverage**: All bounded contexts fully specified
- ✅ **DDD Compliance**: Strategic and tactical design patterns
- ✅ **Test Specifications**: Unit, functional, and behavioral tests
- ✅ **Traceability**: Complete requirements-to-implementation mapping
- ✅ **Mermaid Diagrams**: Visual documentation throughout

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Understanding of Domain-Driven Design principles
- Familiarity with business rules management systems
- Knowledge of enterprise software architecture

### Reading the Documentation
1. Start with the [Executive Summary](./rules-engine-structured-prd/01-executive-summary/README.md)
2. Review the [Domain Models](./rules-engine-structured-prd/DDD/README.md)
3. Explore individual [Feature Specifications](./rules-engine-structured-prd/04-functional-requirements/README.md)
4. Understand the [DSL Grammar](./rules-engine-structured-prd/05-technical-requirements/DSL-GRAMMAR-SPECIFICATION.md)

### Implementation Guidance
The PRD provides implementation-ready specifications including:
- Complete domain models with aggregates and value objects
- API contracts and integration patterns
- Test cases and acceptance criteria
- Performance benchmarks and optimization guidelines
