```

## 8. Best Practices and Pitfalls

### **8.1 Best Practices**
- **Start with Security**: Implement security framework in Phase 1, not as an afterthought
- **API-First Development**: Define contracts before implementation for parallel development
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Use domain events for loose coupling between services
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Implement E2E business workflows and chaos engineering
- **Gradual Rollout**: Use feature flags and canary deployments for risk mitigation

### **8.2 Common Pitfalls to Avoid**
- **Over-Engineering**: Don't create 9 services if 6 would suffice for MVP
- **Security Gaps**: Missing encryption, inadequate access controls, no audit logging
- **Testing Shortcuts**: Skipping E2E tests, no chaos engineering, insufficient coverage
- **Performance Assumptions**: Not defining SLAs, missing caching strategy, no load testing
- **Operational Blindness**: Inadequate monitoring, no disaster recovery, missing runbooks

## Conclusion

This rule provides a comprehensive framework for transforming PRDs into enterprise-grade technical designs. Success depends on systematic application of DDD principles, enterprise security frameworks, comprehensive testing strategies, and realistic implementation planning. The goal is to achieve ★★★★★ (5/5) architecture excellence across all dimensions while maintaining practical implementation feasibility.
