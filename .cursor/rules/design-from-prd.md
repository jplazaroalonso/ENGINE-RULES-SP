## 8. Best Practices and Pitfalls

### **8.1 Best Practices**
- **Start with Security**: Implement security framework in Phase 1, not as an afterthought
- **API-First Development**: Define contracts before implementation for parallel development
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Use domain events for loose coupling between services
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Implement E2E business workflows and chaos engineering
- **Gradual Rollout**: Use feature flags and canary deployments for risk mitigation
- **Detailed Screen Specifications**: Create comprehensive screen designs with component breakdowns before development
- **Shared Component Library**: Build reusable components first to ensure consistency across applications
- **User-Centric Design**: Focus on user workflows and accessibility from the beginning

### **8.2 Common Pitfalls to Avoid**
- **Over-Engineering**: Don't create 9 services if 6 would suffice for MVP
- **Security Gaps**: Missing encryption, inadequate access controls, no audit logging
- **Testing Shortcuts**: Skipping E2E tests, no chaos engineering, insufficient coverage
- **Performance Assumptions**: Not defining SLAs, missing caching strategy, no load testing
- **Operational Blindness**: Inadequate monitoring, no disaster recovery, missing runbooks
- **Generic UI Specifications**: Avoid vague frontend requirements; create detailed screen specifications
- **Component Duplication**: Don't build similar components in multiple places; use shared library
- **Accessibility Afterthought**: Don't add accessibility features later; design inclusively from start

## Conclusion

This rule provides a comprehensive framework for transforming PRDs into enterprise-grade technical designs. Success depends on systematic application of DDD principles, enterprise security frameworks, comprehensive testing strategies, detailed frontend specifications, and realistic implementation planning. The enhanced framework now includes specific guidance for creating detailed screen specifications, reusable component libraries, and user-centric design patterns. The goal is to achieve ★★★★★ (5/5) architecture excellence across all dimensions while maintaining practical implementation feasibility.
