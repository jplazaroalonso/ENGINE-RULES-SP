2. **02-general-description/** - Product description, user personas, and business requirements
3. **03-functional-models-ddd/** - Domain models, bounded contexts, and ubiquitous language
4. **04-functional-requirements/** - Feature specifications and implementation structure
5. **05-technical-requirements/** - Architecture, technology stack, and deployment specifications
6. **06-non-functional-requirements/** - Performance, security, and compliance requirements
7. **07-ui-ux/** - User interface design and user experience specifications
8. **08-success-metrics/** - KPIs, success criteria, and measurement framework
9. **09-appendices/** - Glossary, references, and change log

### Supporting Documentation

7. **FEAT-0007-loyalty-management** - Loyalty program features
8. **FEAT-0008-promotions-management** - Promotional campaign management
9. **FEAT-0009-payments-rules** - Payment processing and security

### Mandatory Files per Bounded Context (9 files)
Each bounded context MUST contain:
1. **feature.md** - Feature overview, objectives, scope, and ADR-lite decisions
2. **domain/model.md** - Complete domain model with aggregates, value objects, services
3. **stories.md** - User stories with acceptance criteria and business value
4. **acceptance.md** - Comprehensive acceptance criteria scenarios
5. **functional-tests.md** - Functional test suites and specifications
6. **behaviour-tests.md** - Behavior-driven development (BDD) scenarios using Gherkin
7. **unit-tests.md** - Unit testing strategy and coverage targets
8. **dependencies.md** - Internal/external service dependencies with SLA requirements
9. **traceability.yaml** - Complete business requirements traceability matrix

## Quality Gates

### Content Quality Requirements

- **Business Traceability**: 100% (complete requirements → implementation mapping)

### User Story Distribution Standards
- **FEAT-0001**: 10+ user stories (comprehensive rule creation workflow)
- **FEAT-0002**: 20+ user stories (high-performance evaluation capabilities)
- **FEAT-0003**: 30+ user stories (complete approval lifecycle management)

## Implementation Guidelines

### When Creating New Bounded Contexts
1. Create all 9 mandatory files
2. Ensure minimum user story count per context
3. Include comprehensive domain models
4. Add complete test coverage specifications
5. Document all dependencies with SLA requirements
6. Create complete traceability matrix

### When Enhancing Existing Contexts
1. Maintain existing file structure
2. Add user stories to meet minimum thresholds
3. Enhance domain models with new capabilities
4. Update test coverage specifications
5. Maintain traceability completeness
6. Update STRUCTURE-OVERVIEW.md with new metrics

### Quality Gate Validation
1. **Pre-Implementation**: Verify all mandatory files exist
2. **Content Review**: Ensure enterprise-grade quality standards
3. **Coverage Check**: Validate user story and test coverage
4. **Traceability**: Confirm complete business requirements mapping
5. **Documentation**: Verify consistent formatting and structure
6. **Final Validation**: Update STRUCTURE-OVERVIEW.md with current metrics
