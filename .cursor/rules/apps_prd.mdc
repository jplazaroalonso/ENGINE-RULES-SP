# PRD (Product Requirements Document) CONSTRUCTION RULE — DDD Approach + Examples
> **Purpose**: To establish an enforceable and verifiable standard for creating **complete**, **section-segmentable**, and **requirement/story-traceable** PRDs under **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**.
  
> **Key principle**: Strict **separation** between **domain logic** (business rules) and **user interfaces** (interaction/presentation).
> **Validation**: Each defined element **MUST** include its **functional**, **behavioural** and **technical (unit)** validation.
---
## 0) Mandatory folder structure
- **PRD root path**: `../`
- **Subfolders by section (all mandatory - 9 sections):**
1. `../01-executive-summary/`
2. `../02-general-description/`
3. `../03-functional-models-ddd/`
4. `../04-functional-requirements/`
5. `../05-technical-requirements/`
6. `../06-non-functional-requirements/`
7. `../07-ui-ux/`
8. `../08-success-metrics/`
9. `../09-appendices/`

> **IMPORTANT**: Section `08-milestones-and-schedule/` has been removed. The structure now contains 9 mandatory sections.

- **Segmentation by feature/requirement/story** (mandatory):
- For **each feature**, a folder will be created in:
- `../04-functional-requirements/features/<ID>-<slug>/`
  
- Minimum structure within each feature folder (all mandatory):
 - `feature.md` (description/value/scope/ADR-lite)
- `domain/` (DDD models specific to the feature)
- `model.md` (entities, aggregates, invariants, policies)
    
- `stories.md` (user stories)
- `acceptance.md` (Given/When/Then criteria)
- `functional-tests.md` (cases in natural language)
 - `behaviour-tests.md` (BDD e2e scenarios)
- `unit-tests.md` (expected technical/unit criteria)
- `dependencies.md` (systems/contracts/feature flags)
- `traceability.yaml` (requirement→criterion→test→metric)

> **Rule**: No requirement/feature will be considered **complete** unless it has **all** of the above pieces in its folder.

## 1) Identification and naming conventions
- **PRD**: `../` (current structure)
- **Feature**: `FEAT-<number>` (e.g. `FEAT-0001`)
- **User story**: `US-<number>` (e.g. `US-0034`)
- **Non-functional requirement**: `NFR-<number>` (e.g. `NFR-0007`)
- **Acceptance criteria**: `AC-<number>`
- **Test case**: `TC-<type>-<number>` (FUNC/BDD/UT/IT)
The ID must appear in the **folder name** and in the **header** of `feature.md`.

## 2) Domain-Driven Design (DDD) Approach
Each **domain** and **subdomain** must be documented in `../03-functional-models-ddd/` with:
- **Ubiquitous language** (glossary).
- **Context Map**: domains, subdomains and relationships (upstream/downstream).
- **Entities and Value Objects** (definitions and invariants).
- **Aggregates and consistency boundaries** (transaction rules).
- **Domain services** (policies, rules).
- **Domain events** (and their semantics).
- **Bounded Contexts** and integration contracts (anti-corruption if applicable).

> **CoT/ADR-lite**: every relevant decision must be recorded in the **Decisions** section within `feature.md` with 4 fields: **Context**, **Alternatives**, **Decision**, **Consequences**. (This is NOT code; it is functional technical rationale).

## 3) Technology and Architecture Requirements

### 3.1 Generic Technology Naming (MANDATORY)
- **Use generic, vendor-neutral technology names** instead of specific product names
- **Examples of generic names to use**:
  - `API Gateway` instead of "Spring Cloud Gateway"
  - `Message Broker` instead of "Kafka"
  - `Database` instead of "PostgreSQL"
  - `Cache` instead of "Redis"
  - `Event Store` instead of specific event store products
  - `Load Balancer` instead of specific load balancer products
  - `Monitoring System` instead of specific monitoring tools

- **Benefits**: 
  - Vendor flexibility and independence
  - Easier technology evaluation and migration
  - Focus on capabilities rather than specific implementations
  - Better for RFPs and vendor selection

### 3.2 Mermaid Diagrams (MANDATORY)
- **All visual elements MUST use Mermaid diagrams** with native markdown syntax
- **Required diagram types**:
  - Architecture diagrams (system components and relationships)
  - Flow diagrams (user journeys, business processes)
  - Class diagrams (domain models, entities, relationships)
  - Sequence diagrams (interactions between components)
  - State diagrams (workflow states and transitions)
  - Metrics and KPIs visualization

- **Mermaid syntax format**:
```markdown
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start] --> B{Decision}
    B -->|Yes| C[Process]
    B -->|No| D[End]
    C --> D
```
```

- **Benefits**:
  - Real-time preview in compatible editors
  - Version control friendly
  - Easy to maintain and update
  - Cross-platform compatibility

### 3.3 SLI/SLO Definitions (MANDATORY)
- **Service Level Indicators (SLIs)** must be defined for all critical system components
- **Service Level Objectives (SLOs)** must specify measurable targets for each SLI
- **Required SLI/SLO categories**:
  - **Performance**: Response time, throughput, latency
  - **Reliability**: Availability, error rates, uptime
  - **Scalability**: Resource utilization, capacity limits
  - **Security**: Authentication success rates, security incident response times
  - **Compliance**: Audit completion rates, regulatory compliance metrics

- **SLI/SLO format**:
```markdown
## SLI/SLO Definitions

### Performance SLIs
- **Response Time**: 95th percentile response time for API calls
- **Throughput**: Requests per second the system can handle

### Performance SLOs
- **Response Time**: 95% of API calls must respond within 200ms
- **Throughput**: System must handle 1000 requests/second under normal load

### Reliability SLIs
- **Availability**: System uptime percentage
- **Error Rate**: Percentage of failed requests

### Reliability SLOs
- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime (8.76 hours downtime per year)
- **Error Rate**: Less than 0.1% of requests should fail
```

## 4) Separation of logic and UI
- **Domain logic**
- Described in `03-functional-models-ddd/` (general level) and in `features/<ID>/domain/` (feature level).
- Contains entities, rules, invariants, and policies.
  
- Technical validation is articulated with **unit tests** (criteria in `unit-tests.md`).
- **User interfaces (UI)**
- Documented in `07-ui-ux/` and, by feature, in `features/<ID>/` (interaction files).
  
- The UI must include **interaction actions** and **events** that trigger domain logic.
- The UI **must not** contain business rules (only flow, screen states, and presentation).

### 4.1 UI/Presentation Rules Clarification
- **Allowed in UI documentation**: 
  - **Conditional presentation logic** (show/hide fields based on user roles or states)
  - **Validation rules for user experience** (field formatting, input masks)
  - **Navigation flow rules** (which screen follows which based on user actions)
  - **Accessibility rules** (screen reader support, keyboard navigation)
- **NOT allowed in UI documentation**:
  - **Business calculation rules** (tax calculations, discount logic)
  - **Data validation rules** (business constraint validation)
  - **Workflow rules** (approval processes, state transitions)
  - **Integration rules** (external system communication logic)
- **Boundary guideline**: If the rule affects **business outcome or data integrity**, it belongs in domain logic. If it affects **user experience or presentation**, it can be in UI documentation.

### 4.2 Comprehensive UI/UX Documentation Structure (MANDATORY)
Each UI feature **MUST** include three key areas documented in `../07-ui-ux/<ID>-<slug>/`:

#### 4.2.1 Detailed User Flows (MANDATORY)
- **Main flow (Happy Path)**: The ideal path a user follows to complete a task without errors
- **Alternative Flows**: Paths users can take when conditions change (e.g., saving drafts, continuing later)
- **Exception Flows**: What happens when users make mistakes or encounter errors
- **Flow documentation format**:
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start: User Action] --> B{Decision Point}
    B -->|Happy Path| C[Success Action]
    B -->|Alternative| D[Alternative Action]
    B -->|Error| E[Error Handling]
    C --> F[End State]
    D --> F
    E --> G[Recovery Action] --> F
```
- **Each step must document**: User action → System response → Next state
- **Clear event mapping**: Actions that trigger domain events must be explicitly identified

#### 4.2.2 Wireframes and Visual Prototypes (MANDATORY)
- **Low-fidelity wireframes**: Simple sketches showing layout structure without design details
- **Interactive prototypes**: Navigable prototypes (Figma, Miro, etc.) for stakeholder validation
- **Reusable components**: Design system components (buttons, inputs, tables) identification
- **Wireframe documentation format**:
```markdown
### Screen: [Screen Name]
**Layout**: [Layout description]
**Components**:
- **[Component Type]**: [Label/Properties]
- **[Component Type]**: [Label/Properties]
**Responsive Behavior**: [Mobile/tablet adaptations]
**Accessibility**: [Screen reader, keyboard navigation]
```

#### 4.2.3 Interaction and Behavior Definitions (MANDATORY)
- **UI States**: All possible component states (loading, empty, data, error, disabled)
- **User Actions**: Precise definition of what happens for each user interaction
- **Domain Event Handling**: How UI reacts to events from business layer
- **Interaction documentation format**:
```markdown
### UI States
- **Initial State**: [Description of default state]
- **Loading State**: [Loading indicators and behavior]
- **Success State**: [Success feedback and transitions]
- **Error State**: [Error display and recovery options]

### User Actions → Domain Events
- **Action**: [User interaction]
  - **UI Response**: [Immediate UI feedback]
  - **Domain Event**: [Event triggered: EVENT_NAME]
  - **Event Payload**: [Data sent to domain]
```

## 5) Content guidelines
- **User stories**
```markdown
As <user type>
I want <action>
So that <benefit/value>
```
- **Acceptance criteria (Gherkin-like)**
```markdown
Given <context>
When <action>
Then <expected result>
```
- **Priority matrix** (MoSCoW/value vs effort)
- **KPIs/OKRs** per feature and global.

## 6) Mandatory templates
### 6.1 Header of `feature.md`
```markdown
# <ID> - <Feature name>
**Objective**: <what it solves and for whom>
**Expected value**: <impact metric (%/£/time)>
**Scope (In/Out)**: <what it includes / what it excludes>
**Assumptions**: <key assumptions>
**Risks**: <risks and mitigations>
## Decisions (ADR-lite / CoT)
- **Context**: <situation and constraints>
- **Alternatives**: <options considered>
- **Decision**: <option chosen and why>
- **Consequences**: <positive/negative impacts>
```
### 6.2 `stories.md`
- Each story **must** be linked to at least one acceptance criterion and its tests.
### 6.3 `acceptance.md`
- Criteria always expressed in **Given/When/Then**.
### 6.4 `functional-tests.md`
- Test cases in natural language, with **preconditions**, **steps**, **data**, **expected result**.
### 6.5 `behaviour-tests.md`
- End-to-end BDD scenarios (main and alternate flows).
### 6.6 `unit-tests.md`
- Units to be tested, inputs/outputs, happy paths/errors, limits, and minimum coverage threshold **≥80%**.
- **DDD Unit Testing Scope**: Test the following domain components:
  - **Entities**: Business logic, invariants, and state transitions
  - **Value Objects**: Immutability, validation, and equality
  - **Aggregates**: Business rules, consistency boundaries, and transaction integrity
  - **Domain Services**: Complex business logic and cross-aggregate operations
  - **Domain Events**: Event creation, payload validation, and event handling
  - **Specifications**: Business rule validation and complex queries
- **Coverage Requirements**: Each domain component must have dedicated unit tests covering business logic, not just technical implementation
### 6.7 `traceability.yaml` (enhanced example)
```yaml
featureId: FEAT-0001
stories:
  - id: US-0001
    criteria:
      - id: AC-01
        tests:
          functional: [TC-FUNC-01]
          behaviour: [TC-BDD-01]
          unit: [TC-UT-01, TC-UT-02]
# Feature-specific success metrics that contribute to global KPIs
successMetrics:
  - kpi: 'Processing success rate'
    objective: '≥ 98% in Q2'
    globalMetricMapping: 'PM-001' # Reference to global metric in 08-success-metrics/
  - kpi: 'Entity creation efficiency'
    objective: '+60% reduction in creation time'
    globalMetricMapping: 'EM-003' # Links to efficiency metrics
coverage:
  requirements: '100%'
  functional tests: '100%'
  unit tests: '>=80%'
# Global project contribution
globalContribution:
  businessValue: 'Reduces manual entity creation effort'
  technicalValue: 'Improves system maintainability'
  riskMitigation: 'Reduces human errors in entity definition'
```

## 6.8) Feature-to-Global Metrics Mapping (MANDATORY)
Each feature's `traceability.yaml` **MUST** explicitly map to global success metrics defined in `../08-success-metrics/`:

- **globalMetricMapping**: Each feature KPI must reference a global metric ID from section 08
- **globalContribution**: Describe how the feature contributes to overall project success
- **impactAssessment**: Quantify the feature's impact on global objectives

**Required mapping format**:
```yaml
successMetrics:
  - kpi: 'Feature-specific metric name'
    objective: 'Measurable target'
    globalMetricMapping: 'GM-XXX' # Must exist in 08-success-metrics/
    impactWeight: 0.15 # Percentage contribution to global metric
globalContribution:
  businessValue: 'How this feature delivers business value'
  technicalValue: 'How this feature improves technical capabilities'
  riskMitigation: 'What risks this feature reduces'
  dependencies: ['GM-001', 'GM-005'] # Other global metrics this affects
```

**Validation Rule**: No feature is complete until its metrics are mapped to global success criteria and impact is quantified.

## 7) Validation rules (gates)
1. **Integrity (MUST)**: Sections 01..09 complete. Each feature with all mandatory files.
2. **Clarity (MUST)**: No ambiguities; glossary/ubiquitous updated.
3. **Traceability (MUST)**: Requirement ↔ Story ↔ Criterion ↔ Test ↔ Metric ↔ Global KPI.
4. **Coverage (MUST)**: 100% functional and behavioural tests; unit tests ≥80% with DDD component coverage.
5. **Technology Naming (MUST)**: Generic, vendor-neutral technology names used throughout.
6. **Mermaid Diagrams (MUST)**: All visual elements use native Mermaid syntax.
7. **SLI/SLO (MUST)**: Service level indicators and objectives defined for all critical components.
8. **Feature-Global Mapping (MUST)**: Each feature's metrics mapped to global success criteria with quantified impact.
9. **UI/Logic Separation (MUST)**: UI documentation follows presentation vs. business logic separation guidelines.
10. **Comprehensive UI/UX (MUST)**: All UI features include detailed user flows, wireframes, and interaction definitions.
11. **DDD Unit Testing (MUST)**: Domain components (entities, aggregates, services, events) properly tested.
12. **Security/Compliance (MUST)**: Documented in technical sections and referenced by feature.
13. **Versioning/Approvals (MUST)**: SemVer + `CHANGELOG.md` + `APPROVALS.md` updated.

## 8) PRD DoD (Definition of Done)
- **Structural completeness**: All 9 sections (01..09) complete and approved.
- **Feature completeness**: 100% of requirements created for the scope with all 8 mandatory files per feature.
- **Test coverage**: 100% functional and behavioural test coverage per requirement.
- **DDD unit testing**: Unit tests with ≥80% coverage including all domain components (entities, aggregates, domain services, events, specifications).
- **Complete traceability**: Full mapping from requirements → stories → criteria → tests → feature metrics → global KPIs.
- **Feature-global mapping**: Each feature's metrics explicitly mapped to global success criteria with quantified impact weights.
- **Technology standards**: All technology names are generic and vendor-neutral.
- **Visual standards**: All visual elements use Mermaid diagrams with native syntax.

- **Event mapping**: All user actions mapped to domain events with clear payloads and UI state responses.
- **Validation passed**: All 13 validation gate rules satisfied.

## 9) Implementation notes for Cursor
- When creating a **new feature**: generate a folder `features/<ID>-<slug>/` with **all** 8 mandatory files.
- Automatically validate that no mandatory files are missing and that `traceability.yaml` is populated with global metric mappings.
- Where information is missing, generate a blocking **TODO** and indicate the section that must be completed.
- **ALWAYS use generic technology names** - never specific product names.
- **ALWAYS include Mermaid diagrams** for visual elements.
- **ALWAYS define SLI/SLO** for critical system components.
- **ALWAYS map feature metrics to global KPIs** with quantified impact weights.
- **ALWAYS include DDD unit testing scope** covering entities, aggregates, domain services, events, and specifications.
- **ALWAYS validate UI/business logic separation** according to section 4.1 guidelines.
- **ALWAYS include comprehensive UI/UX documentation** with three mandatory areas: detailed user flows, wireframes/prototypes, and interaction definitions.
- **ALWAYS map user actions to domain events** with clear event payload specifications.
- **ALWAYS define all UI states** including loading, error, success, and disabled states.
- **ALWAYS ensure comprehensive traceability** from requirements through global KPIs.

## 10) PRACTICAL EXAMPLES (ready to copy/paste)

### 10.1 Domain example (DDD) — **Generic Business Domain**
`../03-functional-models-ddd/core-domain/README.md`
```markdown
# Domain: [Your Business Domain Name]
## Ubiquitous language
- Entity, Process, Transaction, Event, Configuration, Policy, Workflow
## Subdomains
- Core Business Logic (critical)
- Data Processing (critical)
- User Management (support)
## Entities and VOs
- Entity: BusinessEntity { id, name, description, configuration, status, version }
- VO: EntityConfiguration { settings, parameters, constraints } (invariant: valid configuration)
## Aggregates
- BusinessEntity as root. Invariants:
- Cannot be processed if `status != ACTIVE`
- Valid statuses: DRAFT → PENDING_REVIEW → ACTIVE | REJECTED
## Domain services
- ProcessEntity(BusinessEntity, InputData)
## Domain events
- EntityProcessed, EntityApproved, EntityRejected
## Bounded Contexts and contracts
- Core Domain (Upstream) → External Systems (Downstream) via EntityProcessed event
```

### 10.2 Feature example — **FEAT-0001 Entity Management**
`../04-functional-requirements/features/FEAT-0001-entity-management/feature.md`
```markdown
# FEAT-0001 - Entity Management
**Objective**: Allow business users to create, edit, and manage business entities through an intuitive interface.
**Expected value**: ↑ entity creation efficiency +60%, ↓ configuration errors -80%
**Scope (In/Out)**: In: entity creation, editing, versioning. Out: entity processing service.
**Assumptions**: Business users have basic understanding of entity configuration.
**Risks**: Complex configuration syntax may confuse users.
## Decisions (ADR-lite / CoT)
- Context: Need to choose between custom configuration format and existing standards.
- Alternatives: Custom format, JSON Schema, YAML configuration, XML configuration.
- Decision: JSON Schema with visual form builder for business users.
- Consequences: Higher development cost, better user experience, standard compliance.
