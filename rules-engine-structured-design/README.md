# Rules Engine - Structured Design

## Overview

This document provides the complete technical design for the Rules Engine system based on the Product Requirements Document (PRD). The design follows Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles with microservices architecture implemented in Golang for backend services, NATS for messaging, and TypeScript/Vue for presentation layers.

## Design Principles

### Backend Services (Golang)
- **Microservice Architecture**: Each bounded context as independent service
- **REST and gRPC APIs**: External REST, internal gRPC for performance
- **Domain-Driven Design**: Clear domain boundaries and aggregates
- **Event-Driven Communication**: NATS for async messaging
- **Minimum Viable Components**: Small, self-contained building blocks
- **Enterprise Security**: Comprehensive encryption, RBAC, and compliance framework
- **Performance Optimization**: Multi-level caching with sub-second response times

### Integration Layer
- **NATS Messaging**: Publish/subscribe for event-driven communication
- **Event Sourcing**: Complete audit trail and state reconstruction
- **API Gateway (Emissary-Ingress)**: Enhanced authentication, rate limiting, circuit breakers
- **Anti-Corruption Layer**: Protect domain integrity
- **Chaos Engineering**: Resilience testing and failure recovery validation

### Presentation Layer (TypeScript/Vue)
- **Component-Based Architecture**: Reusable UI components
- **Domain Entity Representation**: UI components for each entity type
- **CRUD Operations**: Complete Create, Read, Update, Delete interfaces
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with Progressive Web App features
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript implementation
- **Comprehensive Testing**: E2E testing with business workflow validation
