# Rules Engine - Complete Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive implementation plan for building the Rules Engine system based on the structured design. The plan breaks down the entire system into minimum viable components with specific tasks for each component.

## Project Summary

### System Architecture
- **Backend**: 9 Golang microservices (REST + gRPC)
- **Integration**: NATS messaging with event-driven architecture
- **Frontend**: 3 TypeScript/Vue applications with shared component library

### Key Design Principles
1. **Microservice Independence**: Each service can be developed and deployed independently
2. **Minimum Viable Components**: Break down into smallest possible building blocks
3. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Loose coupling through NATS messaging
4. **Domain-Driven Design**: Clear domain boundaries and ubiquitous language
5. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript implementation across frontend
