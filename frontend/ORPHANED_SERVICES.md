  dateFormat: string
  currency: string
  language: string

## Implementation Priority

1. **High Priority**: Analytics Dashboard (for monitoring existing rules)
2. **Medium Priority**: Settings Management (for system configuration)
3. **Lower Priority**: Campaigns and Customer Management (business-specific features)

## Integration Requirements

Each service should:
- Use the existing authentication system
- Follow the established API patterns
- Integrate with the rules engine for business logic
- Provide proper error handling and validation
- Include comprehensive testing
- Support real-time updates where appropriate

## Next Steps

1. Implement backend services for each orphaned service
2. Create corresponding stores in the frontend
3. Build UI components with full functionality
4. Add proper error handling and loading states
5. Implement real-time updates and notifications
6. Add comprehensive testing
7. Create user documentation and help system
