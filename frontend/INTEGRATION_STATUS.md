## ‚ö†Ô∏è Partially Implemented

### 1. Rules Management Service

#### Missing Endpoints
- **List Rules**: `GET /v1/rules` - Currently returns empty array in frontend

- Rule management is limited to creation and individual retrieval
- Bulk operations are not available

### 2. Authentication Service

#### Current State
- **Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Mock Implementation
- **Issue**: Using mock authentication instead of real backend
- **Impact**: Login works but doesn't connect to actual user management system

## ‚ùå Not Implemented (Orphaned Services)

### 1. Campaigns Management
- **Status**: ‚ùå Placeholder Only
- **Current State**: Basic UI with "will be implemented" message
- **Required Implementation**:
  - Backend service for campaign CRUD operations
  - Campaign-rule integration
  - Campaign scheduling and management
  - Performance tracking

### 2. Customer Management
- **Status**: ‚ùå Placeholder Only
- **Current State**: Basic UI with "will be implemented" message
- **Required Implementation**:
  - Customer CRUD operations
  - Customer segmentation using rules
  - Customer analytics and insights
  - Data import/export capabilities

### 3. Settings Management
- **Status**: ‚ùå Placeholder Only
- **Current State**: Basic UI with "will be implemented" message
- **Required Implementation**:
  - System configuration management
  - User management and permissions
  - Integration settings
  - Notification preferences

## üîß Technical Issues to Address

### 1. Backend Service Limitations

#### Rules Management Service
```go
// Missing handlers that need to be implemented:
- ListRulesHandler
- UpdateRuleHandler  
- DeleteRuleHandler
- BulkOperationsHandler
```

#### Authentication Service
- No dedicated authentication service
- Need to implement user management endpoints
- JWT token validation and refresh

### 2. API Response Format
- Backend services return different response formats
- Need to standardize API responses across all services
- Frontend expects consistent `ApiResponse<T>` format

### 3. Error Handling
- Some backend services don't return structured error responses
- Need consistent error response format
- Frontend error handling could be more granular

|-----------|--------|------------|-------|
| Rules Management | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial | 60% | Core CRUD missing |
| Authentication | ‚ö†Ô∏è Mock | 40% | Needs real backend |
| Analytics | ‚úÖ Mock | 80% | UI complete, needs real data |
| Campaigns | ‚ùå None | 10% | Placeholder only |
| Customers | ‚ùå None | 10% | Placeholder only |
| Settings | ‚ùå None | 10% | Placeholder only |
| Infrastructure | ‚úÖ Complete | 95% | Fully deployed |

## üéØ Success Criteria

The SPA will be considered complete when:

1. ‚úÖ All three backend services are fully integrated
2. ‚úÖ Users can create, read, update, and delete rules
3. ‚úÖ Authentication works with real backend
4. ‚úÖ Analytics shows real system metrics
5. ‚úÖ All orphaned services are implemented
6. ‚úÖ Comprehensive error handling and user feedback
7. ‚úÖ Performance monitoring and alerting
8. ‚úÖ Complete documentation and help system

## üìù Conclusion

The Rules Engine SPA has a solid foundation with professional UI/UX, proper infrastructure deployment, and partial backend integration. The main gaps are in backend service completeness and the implementation of orphaned services. With the identified next steps, the application can be completed to enterprise-grade standards.

**Current State**: 65% Complete
**Estimated Time to Complete**: 2-3 sprints (4-6 weeks)
**Priority**: High - Core functionality needs completion
