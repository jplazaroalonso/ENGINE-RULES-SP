## Overview

This DDD documentation provides a comprehensive view of the Rules Engine domain, following Domain-Driven Design principles to create a shared understanding between business and technical stakeholders. The documentation is organized to support both strategic design decisions and tactical implementation patterns.

### DDD Implementation Approach

The Rules Engine domain implementation follows these DDD principles:

- **Ubiquitous Language**: Consistent terminology across all contexts and communications
- **Bounded Context Clarity**: Clear boundaries and responsibilities for each context
- **Aggregate Design**: Well-defined consistency boundaries and business invariants
- **Domain Events**: Event-driven communication between contexts
- **Strategic Patterns**: Context mapping patterns for integration
- **Tactical Patterns**: Implementation patterns for code organization

### Business Domain Focus

The Rules Engine operates in the **Business Rules Management** domain, focusing on:

- **Dynamic Rule Processing**: Real-time evaluation of business logic
- **Business User Empowerment**: Non-technical rule creation and management
- **Governance and Compliance**: Approval workflows and audit trails
- **High Performance**: Sub-500ms evaluation with 1000+ TPS throughput
- **Enterprise Integration**: Seamless integration with existing systems

### Domain Decomposition Rationale

#### Core Domain: Rules Calculation & Evaluation
- **Strategic Value**: Provides competitive advantage through real-time rule processing
- **Business Criticality**: Essential for customer experience and business operations
- **Technical Complexity**: High - complex algorithms, performance optimization, conflict resolution
- **Investment Priority**: Maximum investment in capability and performance

#### Supporting Domains
- **Rules Management**: Critical for business agility but not differentiating
- **Rules Evaluation**: Important for integration but standard API patterns
- **Domain-Specific Rules**: Business-critical but domain-specific implementations

#### Generic Domains
- **Authentication**: Standard enterprise patterns, buy/leverage existing
- **Audit & Compliance**: Important but standard compliance patterns
- **Integration**: Standard integration patterns and protocols

### Key Design Principles

#### Domain-Centric Design
- **Business Logic First**: Domain models reflect business concepts and rules
- **Technology Independence**: Core domain logic independent of infrastructure
- **Business Language**: Code and documentation use business terminology
- **Domain Expert Collaboration**: Continuous collaboration with business experts

#### Bounded Context Autonomy
- **Independent Evolution**: Contexts can evolve independently
- **Technology Freedom**: Each context can choose appropriate technology
- **Team Ownership**: Clear team ownership and responsibility
- **Service Boundaries**: Context boundaries align with service boundaries

#### Event-Driven Architecture
- **Loose Coupling**: Contexts communicate through events, not direct calls
- **Eventual Consistency**: Accept eventual consistency between contexts
- **Audit Trail**: Complete event history for compliance and debugging
- **Scalability**: Event-driven patterns support horizontal scaling

#### Domain Model Implementation
```java
// Aggregate Root Example
@Entity
@Table(name = "rules")
public class Rule implements AggregateRoot<RuleId> {
    @EmbeddedId
    private RuleId id;
    
    @Embedded
    private RuleName name;
    
    @Embedded
    private DSLContent dslContent;
    
    @Enumerated(EnumType.STRING)
    private RuleStatus status;
    
    @Enumerated(EnumType.STRING)
    private Priority priority;
    
    // Business methods
    public void activate() {
        if (!canBeActivated()) {
            throw new IllegalStateException("Rule cannot be activated");
        }
        this.status = RuleStatus.ACTIVE;
        addEvent(new RuleActivated(this.id, this.name, Instant.now()));
    }
    
    // Invariant enforcement
    private boolean canBeActivated() {
        return status == RuleStatus.APPROVED && dslContent.isValid();
    }
}
```

#### Event Design Patterns
```java
// Domain Event Example
public class RuleActivated implements DomainEvent {
    private final RuleId ruleId;
    private final RuleName ruleName;
    private final Instant occurredAt;
    
    public RuleActivated(RuleId ruleId, RuleName ruleName, Instant occurredAt) {
        this.ruleId = ruleId;
        this.ruleName = ruleName;
        this.occurredAt = occurredAt;
    }
    
    @Override
    public String getEventType() {
        return "rule.activated.v1";
    }
    
    @Override
    public String getAggregateId() {
        return ruleId.getValue();
    }
}
```
