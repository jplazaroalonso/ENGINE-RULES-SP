## Context Relationship Patterns

### Core Domain Integration Patterns

#### Customer/Supplier Pattern: Rules Management → Rules Calculation
**Extracted from**: FEAT-0001 dependencies on FEAT-0002 for rule testing functionality

- **Upstream Context**: Rules Management (Supplier)
- **Downstream Context**: Rules Calculation (Customer)
- **Integration Method**: Domain Events + REST APIs
- **Data Flow**: Rule definitions, lifecycle events, validation requests
- **Responsibilities**: 
  - **Rules Management**: Provides validated, approved rules ready for evaluation
  - **Rules Calculation**: Consumes rules for evaluation processing and testing

**Integration Points** (from dependency analysis):
- Rule testing requires evaluation engine (FEAT-0001 → FEAT-0002 strong dependency)
- Performance analysis depends on evaluation metrics
- Conflict detection uses evaluation logic
- Rule validation service integration

#### Customer/Supplier Pattern: Rules Calculation → Rules Evaluation
**Extracted from**: System architecture showing evaluation services consuming calculation results

- **Upstream Context**: Rules Calculation (Supplier)
- **Downstream Context**: Rules Evaluation (Customer)
- **Integration Method**: Synchronous API calls + Performance Events
- **Data Flow**: Evaluation requests, results, performance metrics
- **Responsibilities**: 
  - **Rules Calculation**: Provides high-performance rule evaluation capabilities
  - **Rules Evaluation**: Formats requests and responses for external systems

### Supporting Domain Integration Patterns

#### Shared Kernel Pattern: Rules Calculation ↔ Rule Evaluator/Calculator
**Extracted from**: FEAT-0005 dependencies showing shared calculation components

- **Shared Model**: Core evaluation algorithms, calculation engines, performance libraries
- **Team Coordination**: Joint ownership of calculation logic (from FEAT-0005 dependencies)

- Performance optimization libraries
- Mathematical operation frameworks

#### Open Host Service Pattern: Rules Calculation → Domain-Specific Contexts
**Extracted from**: Multiple feature dependencies on core evaluation services

- **Service Provider**: Rules Calculation (Host)
- **Published Language**: Standardized evaluation API
- **Service Consumers**: Promotions, Loyalty, Coupons, Taxes & Fees
- **Version Management**: Backward-compatible API evolution

**API Specification** (derived from integration requirements):
```yaml
EvaluateRules:
  endpoint: POST /api/v1/evaluation/evaluate
  timeout: 500ms
  authentication: JWT
  rate_limit: 1000/minute/context

GetRuleDetails:
  endpoint: GET /api/v1/evaluation/rules/{ruleId}
  timeout: 200ms
  cache_ttl: 300s
```

### Generic Domain Integration Patterns

#### Conformist Pattern: Rules Management → Authentication
**Extracted from**: FEAT-0001 dependencies on Authentication Service (OAuth 2.0/JWT)

- **Upstream Context**: Authentication (Dominant - Enterprise Standard)
- **Downstream Context**: Rules Management (Conforming)
- **Constraints**: Must use enterprise OAuth 2.0/SAML standards
- **Adaptation Strategy**: Implement standard authentication client

**Integration Details** (from dependencies.md):
- OAuth 2.0 Provider with JWT tokens
- Role-based access control integration
- Session management and timeout handling
- Enterprise directory integration (LDAP/Active Directory)

#### Anti-Corruption Layer Pattern: Rules Evaluation → Integration
**Extracted from**: Multiple external system dependencies requiring protocol translation

- **External Systems**: POS Systems, E-commerce Platforms, CRM Systems (from general description)
- **Translation Logic**: Protocol translation, data format conversion
- **Isolation Strategy**: Prevent external changes from affecting core domain
- **Maintenance**: Dedicated integration team responsibility

**Protected Internal Model**:
- Core Rules Engine domain model remains stable
- External system changes absorbed by ACL
- Consistent internal API regardless of external variations

#### Published Language Pattern: Core Contexts → Audit & Compliance
**Extracted from**: Compliance requirements and audit logging dependencies

- **Service Providers**: Rules Management, Rules Calculation, Rules Evaluation
- **Published Language**: Standardized audit event format
- **Consuming Context**: Audit & Compliance
- **Stability Guarantee**: Audit event schema backward compatibility

**Event Schema** (derived from compliance requirements):
```yaml
AuditEvent:
  eventId: string
  eventType: string
  timestamp: datetime
  contextName: string
  aggregateId: string
  userId: string
  eventData: object
  compliance:
    sox: boolean
    gdpr: boolean
    retention: duration
```
