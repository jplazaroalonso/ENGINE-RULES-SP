# Acceptance Criteria - Payment Rules and Processing

## AC-001: Smart Payment Method Selection

### Scenario: Optimal payment method recommendation
**Given** a customer with payment history showing 95% success rate with credit cards  
**When** they initiate a $150 purchase  
**Then** the system should recommend their preferred credit card  
**And** show alternative payment methods ranked by success probability  
**And** display expected processing time for each method

### Scenario: Payment method validation
**Given** a customer selects a payment method  
**When** the payment method is validated  
**Then** the system should verify method capabilities against transaction requirements  
**And** check for any restrictions or limitations  
**And** provide immediate feedback on method suitability

## AC-002: Fraud Detection and Prevention

### Scenario: Low-risk transaction processing
**Given** a trusted customer making a typical purchase  
**When** fraud risk assessment is performed  
**Then** the risk score should be "LOW" or "VERY_LOW"  
**And** the transaction should proceed without additional verification  
**And** processing should complete within normal timeframes

### Scenario: High-risk transaction blocking
**Given** a transaction with multiple fraud indicators  
**When** fraud assessment detects high risk  
**Then** the transaction should be automatically blocked  
**And** security team should be immediately alerted  
**And** customer should receive clear explanation of security measures

### Scenario: Medium-risk transaction review
**Given** a transaction with some suspicious patterns  
**When** risk assessment results in "MEDIUM" risk level  
**Then** transaction should be held for manual review  
**And** review queue should be notified within 2 minutes  
**And** customer should be informed of additional verification process

## AC-003: Intelligent Gateway Routing

### Scenario: Optimal gateway selection
**Given** multiple available payment gateways  
**When** gateway selection is performed for a transaction  
**Then** the system should select gateway with best success rate and cost combination  
**And** consider gateway-specific capabilities and restrictions  
**And** document selection reasoning for audit purposes

### Scenario: Gateway failover handling
**Given** primary gateway becomes unavailable  
**When** payment processing is attempted  
**Then** system should automatically failover to backup gateway  
**And** customer should not experience service interruption  
**And** operations team should be notified of gateway failure

### Scenario: Geographic gateway optimization
**Given** a customer in Europe paying for US-based services  
**When** gateway routing is determined  
**Then** system should select gateway optimized for cross-border transactions  
**And** consider currency conversion capabilities  
**And** ensure compliance with both EU and US regulations

## AC-004: Multi-Currency Payment Support

### Scenario: Automatic currency detection
**Given** a customer from Canada accessing the platform  
**When** they view pricing information  
**Then** prices should be displayed in CAD with current exchange rates  
**And** option to switch to USD should be available  
**And** currency conversion fees should be clearly disclosed

### Scenario: Currency conversion accuracy
**Given** a purchase amount of â‚¬100 EUR  
**When** converted to USD for payment processing  
**Then** conversion should use real-time exchange rates  
**And** conversion fees should be calculated transparently  
**And** final USD amount should be displayed before payment confirmation

## AC-005: Payment Retry and Recovery

### Scenario: Automatic retry for temporary failures
**Given** a payment fails due to temporary gateway issues  
**When** retry logic is triggered  
**Then** system should wait 30 seconds and retry with same gateway  
**And** if second attempt fails, switch to alternative gateway  
**And** customer should be kept informed of retry attempts

### Scenario: Payment method failure handling
**Given** a payment fails due to insufficient funds  
**When** failure is detected  
**Then** system should suggest alternative payment methods  
**And** allow customer to easily select different method  
**And** preserve cart contents and session information

## AC-006: Compliance and Security

### Scenario: PCI DSS compliance validation
**Given** a credit card payment transaction  
**When** card data is processed  
**Then** all card data must be encrypted in transit and at rest  
**And** no sensitive card data should be stored after processing  
**And** PCI DSS compliance audit trail should be maintained

### Scenario: AML screening for large transactions
**Given** a transaction over $10,000 USD  
**When** AML screening is performed  
**Then** customer should be checked against sanctions lists  
**And** transaction patterns should be analyzed for suspicious activity  
**And** compliance officer should be notified for review if needed

### Scenario: KYC verification requirement
**Given** a new customer attempting high-value transaction  
**When** KYC verification is triggered  
**Then** customer should be prompted for identity verification  
**And** transaction should be held pending verification completion  
**And** clear instructions should be provided for verification process

## AC-007: Performance and Reliability

### Scenario: Payment processing speed
**Given** a standard payment transaction  
**When** processing is initiated  
**Then** payment method selection should complete within 100ms  
**And** fraud assessment should complete within 200ms  
**And** gateway routing should complete within 150ms  
**And** total processing initiation should be under 500ms

### Scenario: High-volume processing capability
**Given** 1000 concurrent payment transactions  
**When** system processes all transactions  
**Then** average processing time should not exceed 2 seconds  
**And** success rate should remain above 99%  
**And** no transactions should be lost or corrupted

## AC-008: Mobile Payment Optimization

### Scenario: Mobile wallet integration
**Given** a customer using mobile device with Apple Pay enabled  
**When** they select payment method  
**Then** Apple Pay should be offered as primary option  
**And** biometric authentication should be supported  
**And** payment should complete with minimal user interaction

### Scenario: Mobile-optimized fraud detection
**Given** a mobile payment transaction  
**When** fraud assessment is performed  
**Then** device fingerprinting should be included in risk analysis  
**And** mobile-specific behavior patterns should be considered  
**And** location-based verification should be available
