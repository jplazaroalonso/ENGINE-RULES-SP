# Payment Rules Domain Model

## Bounded Context: Payment Processing and Rules

### Context Purpose
The Payment Rules bounded context is responsible for intelligent payment processing, including payment method selection, fraud prevention, gateway routing, currency handling, and payment optimization. This context ensures secure, efficient, and compliant payment processing while maximizing success rates and minimizing costs through intelligent rule-driven decision making.
