## ADR-lite Decisions

### ADR-001: Tax Calculation Engine Architecture
**Context**: Need to choose between custom tax engine and third-party tax service integration
**Alternatives**: 
- Custom tax calculation engine with local tax data
- Integration with external tax service providers (Avalara, TaxJar, etc.)
- Hybrid approach with fallback capabilities

**Decision**: Hybrid approach with external service integration and local fallback
**Consequences**: 
- ✅ Leverage specialized tax service provider expertise
- ✅ Maintain service availability with local fallback
- ✅ Reduce maintenance overhead for tax rate updates
- ❌ External service dependency for real-time calculations
- ❌ Increased integration complexity

### ADR-002: Jurisdiction Data Management
**Context**: Need to determine how to manage jurisdiction boundaries and tax rates
**Alternatives**:
- Local jurisdiction database with manual updates
- Real-time jurisdiction lookup via external services
- Cached jurisdiction data with periodic synchronization

**Decision**: Cached jurisdiction data with periodic synchronization
**Consequences**:
- ✅ Fast jurisdiction lookup performance
- ✅ Reduced external API calls for better performance
- ✅ Data consistency across calculation sessions
- ❌ Potential for temporary data staleness
- ❌ Cache management complexity

### ADR-003: Tax Exemption Handling
**Context**: Need to define how tax exemptions and special rates are processed
**Alternatives**:
- Static exemption rules in configuration
- Customer-specific exemption certificates
- Real-time exemption validation with authorities

**Decision**: Customer-specific exemption certificates with validation
**Consequences**:
- ✅ Accurate customer-specific tax treatment
- ✅ Compliance with exemption documentation requirements
- ✅ Audit trail for exemption usage
