- Coupon usage data is available for analytics and fraud detection
- Marketing teams have defined coupon campaign requirements

## Risks
### High Risk
- **Fraud and Abuse**: Risk of coupon fraud through code generation patterns or unauthorized distribution
- **Performance Impact**: Risk of validation delays affecting checkout experience
- **Integration Complexity**: Risk of integration issues with multiple sales channels

### Medium Risk
- **Campaign Conflicts**: Risk of coupon conflicts with other promotional rules
- **Scalability Issues**: Risk of performance degradation during high-volume redemption periods
- **Data Consistency**: Risk of coupon state inconsistency across multiple channels

### Low Risk
- **User Experience**: Risk of complex coupon application affecting customer experience
- **Reporting Accuracy**: Risk of incomplete usage tracking affecting campaign analysis

## ADR-lite Decisions

### ADR-001: Coupon Code Generation Strategy
**Context**: Need to balance security, uniqueness, and user-friendliness in coupon codes
**Alternatives**: 
- Simple sequential codes for easy use
- Complex random codes for security
- Pattern-based codes with validation checksums

**Decision**: Pattern-based codes with configurable complexity and validation checksums
**Consequences**: 
- ✅ Balances security with usability
- ✅ Prevents simple code guessing attacks
- ✅ Configurable for different campaign needs
- ❌ Slightly more complex code generation
- ❌ Validation overhead for checksum verification

### ADR-002: Multi-Channel Validation Architecture
**Context**: Need to handle coupon validation across web, mobile, and in-store channels
**Alternatives**:
- Centralized validation service for all channels
- Channel-specific validation with synchronization
- Distributed validation with eventual consistency

**Decision**: Centralized validation service with channel-specific adapters
**Consequences**:
- ✅ Consistent validation logic across channels
- ✅ Real-time usage tracking and fraud prevention
- ✅ Simplified business rule management
- ❌ Single point of failure risk
- ❌ Network dependency for validation

### ADR-003: Fraud Detection Implementation
**Context**: Need to prevent coupon fraud while maintaining user experience
**Alternatives**:
- Rule-based fraud detection
- Machine learning-based pattern recognition
- Hybrid approach with configurable rules and ML enhancement

**Decision**: Hybrid approach starting with rule-based detection and ML enhancement capability
**Consequences**:
- ✅ Immediate fraud protection with known patterns
- ✅ Ability to evolve detection capabilities
- ✅ Configurable thresholds for different risk levels
- ❌ Initial ML implementation complexity
- ❌ Training data requirements for ML models

### ADR-004: Coupon State Management
**Context**: Need to track coupon state across creation, distribution, and redemption
**Alternatives**:
- Simple status-based state management
- Event-driven state tracking
- Immutable event sourcing approach

**Decision**: Event-driven state tracking with command/event separation
**Consequences**:
- ✅ Complete audit trail for compliance
- ✅ Real-time state updates across channels
- ✅ Support for complex business workflows
- ❌ Increased system complexity
- ❌ Event storage and processing overhead

### ADR-005: Integration with Promotional Rules
**Context**: Need to coordinate coupons with other promotional rules and loyalty programs
**Alternatives**:
- Independent coupon processing
- Tight integration with promotional rule engine
- Loose coupling through event-driven integration

**Decision**: Loose coupling through event-driven integration with promotional rule engine
**Consequences**:
- ✅ Flexibility in promotional campaign design
- ✅ Reduced system coupling and dependencies
- ✅ Easier testing and maintenance
- ❌ Potential for integration complexity
- ❌ Eventual consistency considerations
