# Behaviour Tests - Rule Evaluator/Calculator

## TC-BEH-01: Real-Time Rule Evaluation
**Scenario**: System processes transaction rules in real-time
**Given** I have a transaction requiring rule evaluation
**And** the system has multiple applicable rules loaded
**When** I request rule evaluation for the transaction
**Then** evaluation should complete within 500ms
**And** all applicable rules should be processed
**And** final benefits should be calculated accurately
**And** calculation audit trail should be generated

## TC-BEH-02: Automatic Conflict Resolution
**Scenario**: System automatically resolves rule conflicts
**Given** I have multiple rules that conflict for the same transaction
**And** rules have different priority levels
**When** conflict resolution is performed
**Then** conflicts should be detected automatically
**And** highest priority rule should be applied
**And** resolution decision should be documented
**And** final result should reflect priority-based resolution

## TC-BEH-03: High-Throughput Processing
**Scenario**: System handles high transaction volume
**Given** the system is processing 1000+ transactions per second
**And** each transaction requires rule evaluation
**When** high volume load is sustained
**Then** system should maintain performance targets
**And** calculation accuracy should be preserved
**And** system stability should be maintained
**And** no transactions should be lost or corrupted

## TC-BEH-04: Multi-Domain Calculation Integration
**Scenario**: System integrates calculations across multiple rule domains
**Given** I have a transaction with promotions, loyalty, and tax rules
**And** each domain has specific calculation requirements
**When** multi-domain evaluation is performed
**Then** each domain should calculate its results correctly
**And** cross-domain interactions should be handled properly
**And** final aggregated result should be accurate
**And** domain-specific audit trails should be maintained

## TC-BEH-05: Performance Optimization
**Scenario**: System optimizes calculation performance continuously
**Given** the system is monitoring calculation performance
**And** optimization opportunities are identified
**When** performance optimization is triggered
**Then** hot path rules should be compiled for better performance
**And** caching should be optimized for frequently accessed data
**And** resource utilization should be improved
**And** optimization should not affect calculation accuracy
