# Functional Tests - Rule Evaluator/Calculator

## TC-FUNC-01: High-Performance Rule Evaluation
**Prerequisites**: Rule evaluation engine configured, test rules loaded
**Steps**: 
1. Submit single rule evaluation request
2. Measure evaluation response time
3. Verify calculation accuracy
4. Check result completeness
5. Validate performance metrics

**Test Data**: 
- Complex rule with multiple conditions
- Transaction context with customer and product data
- Expected calculation result

**Expected Results**: 
- Evaluation completes within 500ms (95th percentile)
- Calculation result is mathematically accurate
- Complete evaluation metadata provided
- Performance metrics collected

## TC-FUNC-02: Conflict Resolution Processing
**Prerequisites**: Conflicting rules configured, resolution strategies defined
**Steps**:
1. Submit transaction with conflicting applicable rules
2. Verify conflict detection
3. Check resolution strategy application
4. Validate final result
5. Confirm audit trail completeness

**Test Data**:
- Multiple rules with overlapping conditions
- Different rule priorities
- Expected resolution outcome

**Expected Results**:
- All conflicts detected automatically
- Priority-based resolution applied correctly
- Final result reflects highest priority rule
- Complete audit trail generated

## TC-FUNC-03: Multi-Domain Result Aggregation
**Prerequisites**: Rules from multiple domains configured, aggregation logic implemented
**Steps**:
1. Submit transaction applicable to multiple domains
2. Execute domain-specific calculations
3. Perform result aggregation
4. Verify cross-domain interactions
5. Validate final aggregated result

**Test Data**:
- Promotion discount rule
- Loyalty points rule
- Tax calculation rule
- Fee calculation rule

**Expected Results**:
- Each domain calculation executed correctly
- Results aggregated without conflicts
- Cross-domain interactions handled properly
- Final transaction benefit calculated accurately

## TC-FUNC-04: High-Volume Performance Testing
**Prerequisites**: Load testing environment, performance monitoring active
**Steps**:
1. Generate high-volume calculation load (1000+ TPS)
2. Monitor system performance under load
3. Verify calculation accuracy maintained
4. Check system stability
5. Validate scaling behavior

**Test Data**:
- 1000+ concurrent calculation requests
- Sustained load over 30 minutes
- Various transaction types and complexity

**Expected Results**:
- System sustains 1000+ TPS
- Calculation accuracy maintained under load
- No system failures or degradation
- Linear scaling with additional resources

## TC-FUNC-05: Caching Effectiveness
**Prerequisites**: Caching system configured, cache monitoring enabled
**Steps**:
1. Submit repeated calculation requests
2. Monitor cache hit rates
3. Test cache invalidation
4. Measure performance improvements
5. Validate cache consistency

**Test Data**:
- Repeated rule evaluations
- Common transaction patterns
- Cache expiration scenarios

**Expected Results**:
- Cache hit rates above 80%
- Significant performance improvement from caching
- Cache invalidation works correctly
- Data consistency maintained
