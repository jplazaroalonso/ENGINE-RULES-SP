# FEAT-0001 - Rule Creation and Management

**Objective**: Enable business users to create and manage business rules using DSL without technical intervention
**Expected Value**: 80% reduction in rule creation time, faster time-to-market for business changes
**Scope (In/Out)**: In: DSL-based rule creation, validation, testing, templates. Out: Code-based rule development, complex rule chaining
**Assumptions**: Users have basic understanding of business logic, DSL is intuitive enough for business users
**Risks**: DSL complexity may limit adoption, validation errors may frustrate users

## Decisions (ADR-lite / CoT)

### Decision 1: DSL vs Visual Builder
- **Context**: Need for business user-friendly rule creation that balances power with usability
- **Alternatives**: Visual builder (drag-and-drop), DSL (text-based), natural language processing
- **Decision**: DSL with comprehensive templates and real-time validation
- **Consequences**: Learning curve for DSL but provides powerful and flexible rule creation, templates reduce complexity

### Decision 2: Rule Validation Strategy
- **Context**: Need to ensure rules are syntactically and semantically correct before execution
- **Alternatives**: Pre-execution validation, runtime validation, hybrid approach
- **Decision**: Pre-execution validation with real-time feedback and comprehensive error messages
- **Consequences**: Better user experience with immediate feedback, but requires robust validation engine

### Decision 3: Template System
- **Context**: Need to simplify rule creation for common business scenarios
- **Alternatives**: No templates, basic templates, comprehensive template library
- **Decision**: Comprehensive template library covering common promotional and loyalty scenarios
- **Consequences**: Faster rule creation for common cases, but requires template maintenance and updates
