# Acceptance Criteria - Rule Creation and Management

## AC-01: Rule Template Selection

**Given** a user wants to create a new rule  
**When** they access the rule creation interface  
**Then** they should see available rule templates organized by category  
**And** they can select the appropriate template for their use case  
**And** template details and preview should be displayed  
**And** templates should include discount, loyalty, and promotion categories

**Alternative Flow**:  
**Given** no suitable template exists  
**When** user selects "Create from Scratch"  
**Then** they should access the blank rule creation interface

---

## AC-02: DSL Rule Definition

**Given** a user has selected a rule template or blank interface  
**When** they define rule conditions using DSL  
**Then** the system should provide syntax highlighting and auto-completion  
**And** real-time validation feedback should be displayed  
**And** DSL documentation should be accessible via help system  
**And** common DSL patterns should be suggested

**Error Flow**:  
**Given** user enters invalid DSL syntax  
**When** they move to the next field  
**Then** specific error messages should be displayed with correction suggestions  
**And** the cursor should be positioned at the error location

---

## AC-03: Rule Validation

**Given** a user has defined a rule using DSL  
**When** they submit the rule for validation  
**Then** the system should check syntax and semantics within 2 seconds  
**And** any errors should be clearly indicated with specific line numbers  
**And** warnings for potential conflicts should be displayed  
**And** validation should check for business logic consistency

**Business Logic Validation**:  
**Given** a rule contains business logic  
**When** validation is performed  
**Then** system should verify rule doesn't conflict with existing active rules  
**And** performance impact should be assessed and displayed  
**And** data dependencies should be validated

---

## AC-04: Rule Testing

**Given** a user has created a rule  
**When** they want to test the rule  
**Then** they should be able to provide sample transaction data  
**And** see the expected results of rule execution within 3 seconds  
**And** test results should show step-by-step rule evaluation  
**And** multiple test scenarios should be supported

**Test Scenarios**:  
**Given** a rule is being tested  
**When** user runs test scenarios  
**Then** system should support predefined test data sets  
**And** custom test data should be accepted  
**And** edge cases should be testable  
**And** test results should be saveable for future reference

---

## AC-05: Rule Status Management

**Given** a rule has been created and tested  
**When** the user saves the rule  
**Then** it should be stored with DRAFT status  
**And** rule should be ready for submission to approval workflow  
**And** rule status should be clearly displayed  
**And** status history should be maintained

**Status Transitions**:  
**Given** a rule exists in any status  
**When** status changes occur  
**Then** valid status transitions should be enforced:  
- DRAFT → UNDER_REVIEW  
- UNDER_REVIEW → APPROVED | REJECTED  
- APPROVED → ACTIVE  
- ACTIVE → INACTIVE  
- INACTIVE → ACTIVE | ARCHIVED  

---

## AC-06: Template Application

**Given** a user has selected a template  
**When** they apply the template  
**Then** template content should populate the rule editor  
**And** template variables should be highlighted for customization  
**And** template documentation should be displayed  
**And** user should be able to modify template content

**Template Customization**:  
**Given** a template is applied  
**When** user modifies template content  
**Then** changes should be tracked as customizations  
**And** original template should remain unchanged  
**And** user should be able to reset to original template

---

## AC-08: Rule Cloning

**Given** a user wants to clone an existing rule  
**When** they select a rule to clone  
**Then** a new rule should be created with copied content  
**And** cloned rule should have DRAFT status  
**And** cloned rule should have unique identifier  
**And** clone relationship should be tracked in history

**Clone Customization**:  
**Given** a rule is cloned  
**When** user modifies the cloned rule  
**Then** changes should not affect the original rule  
**And** clone should be independently manageable  
**And** clone origin should be visible in rule metadata

---

## Cross-Cutting Acceptance Criteria

### Performance Requirements
**Given** any rule creation operation  
**When** user performs the action  
**Then** response time should be <2 seconds for validation  
**And** response time should be <3 seconds for testing  
**And** system should remain responsive during operations

### Security Requirements
**Given** any rule creation operation  
**When** user performs the action  
**Then** user permissions should be validated  
**And** rule access should be based on user role  
**And** all operations should be audit logged

### Usability Requirements
**Given** any rule creation interface  
**When** user interacts with the system  
**Then** interface should be accessible (WCAG 2.1 AA)  
**And** error messages should be clear and actionable  
**And** help documentation should be contextually available

### Data Integrity Requirements
**Given** any rule creation operation  
**When** data is saved  
**Then** rule data should be validated before storage  
**And** concurrent editing should be handled gracefully  
**And** data corruption should be prevented through validation

## Acceptance Test Strategy

### Testing Approach
1. **Happy Path Testing**: Verify successful completion of primary flows
2. **Alternative Path Testing**: Verify system handles alternative scenarios
3. **Error Path Testing**: Verify graceful error handling and recovery
4. **Edge Case Testing**: Verify system handles boundary conditions
5. **Integration Testing**: Verify integration with dependent systems

### Test Data Requirements
- Valid DSL syntax examples
- Invalid DSL syntax examples
- Sample transaction data for testing
- Template test data
- User role and permission test data
- Performance test data sets

### Environment Requirements
- Development environment with full feature set
- Test data matching production patterns
- User accounts with appropriate permissions
- Integration with dependent services
- Performance monitoring tools
