# FEAT-0003 - Rule Approval Workflow

## Feature Overview
**Objective**: Provide a comprehensive approval workflow system for business rules with multi-level approval, compliance validation, risk assessment, and audit trail capabilities

**Expected Value**: 
- **Compliance Assurance**: 100% regulatory compliance coverage through systematic validation
- **Risk Mitigation**: 95% reduction in rule deployment risks through structured approval process
- **Audit Transparency**: Complete traceability of all rule changes and approvals
- **Operational Efficiency**: 60% faster rule approval cycles through automated workflows
- **Quality Improvement**: 80% reduction in rule-related incidents through validation gates

## Scope
### In Scope
- Multi-level approval workflows with configurable steps
- Compliance validation and risk assessment engines
- Automated workflow routing and escalation
- Comprehensive audit trail and reporting
- Integration with rule management system
- Role-based access control and permissions
- Workflow templates and customization
- Performance monitoring and SLA tracking

### Out of Scope
- External compliance system integrations
- Advanced machine learning for risk assessment
- Mobile application interfaces
- Real-time collaboration features
- Advanced analytics and business intelligence

## Assumptions
- Business rules require approval before activation
- Multiple stakeholders need to review rule changes
- Compliance requirements vary by rule type and business domain
- Workflow complexity varies by organization size and structure
- Audit requirements mandate complete change tracking

## Risks
### High Risk
- **Complex Workflow Configuration**: Risk of creating overly complex approval processes
- **Performance Impact**: Risk of workflow delays affecting business agility
- **Integration Complexity**: Risk of workflow system integration issues

### Medium Risk
- **User Adoption**: Risk of resistance to structured approval processes
- **Compliance Changes**: Risk of regulatory requirement changes affecting workflows
- **Scalability**: Risk of performance degradation with high rule volumes

### Low Risk
- **Technology Maturity**: Risk of workflow engine limitations
- **Data Migration**: Risk of historical approval data migration issues

## ADR-lite Decisions

### ADR-001: Workflow Engine Architecture
**Context**: Need to choose between custom workflow engine and existing BPMN solutions
**Alternatives**: 
- Custom workflow engine with domain-specific modeling
- BPMN-compliant workflow engine (e.g., Camunda, Activiti)
- Rule engine with embedded workflow capabilities

**Decision**: Custom workflow engine with domain-specific modeling
**Consequences**: 
- ✅ Better alignment with business rule domain concepts
- ✅ Simplified user experience for business users
- ✅ Easier integration with rule management system
- ❌ Higher development and maintenance costs
- ❌ Limited tooling ecosystem

### ADR-002: Approval Step Configuration
**Context**: Need to define how approval steps are configured and managed
**Alternatives**:
- Fixed approval steps defined at system level
- Configurable approval steps with template support
- Dynamic approval steps based on rule complexity and risk

**Decision**: Configurable approval steps with template support
**Consequences**:
- ✅ Flexibility to adapt to different business processes
- ✅ Reusable templates for common approval patterns
- ✅ Balance between flexibility and complexity
- ❌ Requires careful template design and governance
- ❌ Potential for inconsistent approval processes

### ADR-003: Compliance Validation Strategy
**Context**: Need to determine how compliance validation is performed
**Alternatives**:
- Pre-built compliance rules for common regulations
- Configurable compliance rules with business logic
- Integration with external compliance systems

**Decision**: Configurable compliance rules with business logic
**Consequences**:
- ✅ Adaptable to changing compliance requirements
- ✅ Business users can define and modify compliance rules
- ✅ No external system dependencies
- ❌ Requires business user training on compliance rule creation
- ❌ Risk of incorrect compliance rule configuration

### ADR-004: Risk Assessment Methodology
**Context**: Need to define how risk assessment is performed for rule changes
**Alternatives**:
- Simple risk scoring based on rule attributes
- Advanced risk modeling with machine learning
- Hybrid approach combining rule-based and ML-based assessment

**Decision**: Hybrid approach combining rule-based and ML-based assessment
**Consequences**:
- ✅ Balances accuracy with interpretability
- ✅ Can start with rule-based approach and evolve
- ✅ Provides explainable risk assessments
- ❌ More complex implementation and maintenance
- ❌ Requires training data for ML components

### ADR-005: Audit Trail Granularity
**Context**: Need to determine the level of detail for audit trail records
**Alternatives**:
- High-level workflow state changes only
- Detailed step-by-step approval actions
- Complete audit trail with before/after rule states

**Decision**: Complete audit trail with before/after rule states
**Consequences**:
- ✅ Maximum transparency and compliance coverage
- ✅ Complete change history for troubleshooting
- ✅ Meets strict audit requirements
- ❌ Higher storage requirements
- ❌ Potential performance impact on large rule sets
