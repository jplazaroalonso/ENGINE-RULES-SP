- **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff for transient failures
- **Timeout Management**: Appropriate timeouts for all service calls
- **Health Checks**: Continuous monitoring of dependency health

### Data Consistency Patterns
- **Eventual Consistency**: Accept eventual consistency for non-critical data
- **Compensation Patterns**: Implement compensation for failed evaluations
- **Event Sourcing**: Maintain event log for complete audit trail
- **CQRS**: Separate read and write models for performance

### Performance Optimization

- **Connection Pooling**: Efficient connection management
- **Async Processing**: Asynchronous processing for non-blocking operations
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute load across multiple service instances

### Security Patterns
- **API Authentication**: Secure all API communications
- **Data Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data in transit and at rest
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation of all inputs

## Dependency Monitoring and Management

### Real-time Monitoring
```yaml
Health Checks:
  - dependency_availability: Monitor service endpoint health
  - response_time_monitoring: Track API response times
  - error_rate_tracking: Monitor service error rates
  - circuit_breaker_status: Track circuit breaker state

Performance Metrics:
  - service_response_times: P50, P95, P99 response times
  - throughput_monitoring: Requests per second tracking
  - error_rate_analysis: Error rate trends and patterns
  - dependency_utilization: Resource usage patterns

Alerting Thresholds:
  - response_time: >200ms for P95 (internal), >500ms (external)
  - error_rate: >0.1% for internal, >1% for external
  - availability: <99.5% for critical dependencies
  - circuit_breaker: Any circuit breaker opens
```

### Dependency Update Management
