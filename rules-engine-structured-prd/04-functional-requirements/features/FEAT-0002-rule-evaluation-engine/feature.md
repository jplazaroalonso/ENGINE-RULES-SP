# FEAT-0002 - Rule Evaluation Engine

**Objective**: Provide high-performance rule evaluation for real-time transactions with conflict resolution and caching capabilities
**Expected Value**: <500ms evaluation time, 1000+ TPS, improved customer experience and system reliability
**Scope (In/Out)**: In: Real-time rule evaluation, conflict resolution, performance optimization, caching. Out: Rule creation, approval workflows, user interface
**Assumptions**: Rules are pre-validated and approved, sufficient system resources available, external data sources are accessible
**Risks**: High transaction volume may impact performance, complex rule conflicts may slow evaluation, cache invalidation complexity

## Decisions (ADR-lite / CoT)

### Decision 1: Evaluation Strategy
- **Context**: Need to evaluate multiple rules against transaction data with sub-500ms response time
- **Alternatives**: Sequential evaluation, parallel evaluation, hybrid approach with priority-based execution
- **Decision**: Hybrid approach with priority-based parallel evaluation and early termination
- **Consequences**: Better performance for complex rule sets, requires careful conflict resolution, increased complexity in rule ordering

### Decision 2: Conflict Resolution Strategy
- **Context**: Multiple rules may conflict when applied to the same transaction
- **Alternatives**: First-match wins, priority-based resolution, business rule-based resolution, user-defined resolution
- **Decision**: Priority-based resolution with business rule fallback and comprehensive conflict reporting
- **Consequences**: Predictable behavior, requires clear priority definition, may need business rule updates for edge cases

### Decision 3: Caching Strategy
- **Context**: Rule evaluation performance is critical for real-time transactions
- **Alternatives**: No caching, rule-level caching, result-level caching, multi-level caching
- **Decision**: Multi-level caching with rule compilation cache and result cache with intelligent invalidation
- **Consequences**: Significant performance improvement, requires cache invalidation strategy, increased memory usage

### Decision 4: Performance Optimization
- **Context**: Must handle 1000+ TPS with sub-500ms response time
- **Alternatives**: Single-threaded evaluation, multi-threading, async evaluation, distributed evaluation
- **Decision**: Async evaluation with thread pool and connection pooling for external data access
- **Consequences**: Better resource utilization, requires careful thread management, potential for race conditions

### Decision 5: Error Handling Strategy
- **Context**: Rule evaluation failures should not impact overall system availability
- **Alternatives**: Fail-fast, fail-safe with defaults, circuit breaker pattern, graceful degradation
- **Decision**: Circuit breaker pattern with graceful degradation and comprehensive error reporting
- **Consequences**: Improved system resilience, requires fallback rule definitions, increased monitoring complexity
