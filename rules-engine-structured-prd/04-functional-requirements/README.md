```

## Acceptance Criteria Framework

All acceptance criteria follow the Given/When/Then format:

- **Given**: Preconditions and context
- **When**: Action or event that occurs
- **Then**: Expected outcome or result
- **And**: Additional expected outcomes

## Testing Strategy

### Test Coverage Requirements
- **Functional Tests**: 100% coverage of all user stories
- **Behavior Tests**: 100% coverage of all acceptance criteria
- **Unit Tests**: ≥80% coverage of all business logic
- **Integration Tests**: Complete end-to-end workflow validation

### Test Types
1. **Functional Tests**: Business logic validation and workflow testing
2. **Behavior Tests**: BDD scenarios for user experience validation
3. **Unit Tests**: Individual component and service testing
4. **Performance Tests**: Load testing and performance validation
5. **Security Tests**: Authentication, authorization, and data protection
