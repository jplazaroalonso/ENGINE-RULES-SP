### 🔄 Priority 2: Remaining Bounded Contexts (In Progress)
- [x] FEAT-0008: 6/9 files complete ✅ domain model, stories, acceptance, dependencies, traceability
- [ ] FEAT-0008: Missing functional-tests.md, behaviour-tests.md, unit-tests.md
- [x] FEAT-0009: 1/9 files complete ✅ feature.md only
- [ ] FEAT-0009: Missing 8 remaining mandatory files

### ✅ Priority 3: Enhanced Documentation Infrastructure - COMPLETED
