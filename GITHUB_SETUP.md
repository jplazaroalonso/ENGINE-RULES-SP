# GitHub Repository Setup Guide

This guide will help you create and set up the Rules Engine PRD project on GitHub.

## Step 1: Initialize Git Repository (Local)

Open terminal in your project directory and run:

```bash
cd /Users/juanpablolazaroalonso/SW/ENGINE-RULES-SP
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Complete Rules Engine PRD with DDD implementation

- Added comprehensive PRD following DDD principles
- Implemented all required bounded contexts (Coupons, Loyalty, Promotions, Payments, Taxes)
- Created complete DSL grammar specification with ANTLR4
- Added domain models, context maps, and integration patterns
- Included comprehensive test specifications and traceability
- Documentation follows enterprise standards with Mermaid diagrams"
```

## Step 2: Create GitHub Repository

### Option A: Using GitHub Web Interface

1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and sign in
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner
3. Select "New repository"
4. Fill in the repository details:
   - **Repository name**: `rules-engine-prd`
   - **Description**: `Enterprise Rules Engine - Complete Product Requirements Document with Domain-Driven Design`
   - **Visibility**: Choose Public or Private
   - **Don't initialize** with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
5. Click "Create repository"

### Option B: Using GitHub CLI (if you have gh CLI installed)

```bash
# Create repository
gh repo create rules-engine-prd --public --description "Enterprise Rules Engine - Complete Product Requirements Document with Domain-Driven Design"

# Or for private repository
gh repo create rules-engine-prd --private --description "Enterprise Rules Engine - Complete Product Requirements Document with Domain-Driven Design"
```

## Step 3: Connect Local Repository to GitHub

After creating the repository on GitHub, connect your local repository:

```bash
# Add the remote origin (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/rules-engine-prd.git

# Verify the remote was added correctly
git remote -v

# Push your code to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 4: Set Up Repository Features

### Enable GitHub Pages (Optional)
If you want to host the documentation:

1. Go to repository Settings
2. Scroll down to "Pages" section
3. Select source: "Deploy from a branch"
4. Choose branch: "main" and folder: "/ (root)"
5. Click "Save"

### Add Repository Topics
Add relevant topics to make your repository discoverable:

1. Go to your repository main page
2. Click the gear icon next to "About"
3. Add topics: `rules-engine`, `domain-driven-design`, `ddd`, `prd`, `product-requirements`, `antlr4`, `dsl`, `business-rules`, `enterprise-software`

### Create Repository Sections

#### Add Repository Description
In the "About" section, add:
- **Description**: `Enterprise Rules Engine - Complete Product Requirements Document with Domain-Driven Design implementation. Includes DSL grammar, bounded contexts for Coupons/Loyalty/Promotions/Payments/Taxes, and comprehensive specifications.`
- **Website**: (if you set up GitHub Pages)
- **Topics**: (as mentioned above)

## Step 5: Create Release

Create your first release to mark the completion:

```bash
# Create and push a tag
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release v1.0.0: Complete Rules Engine PRD

- Complete PRD with all 9 mandatory sections
- All bounded contexts implemented (Coupons, Loyalty, Promotions, Payments, Taxes)
- DSL grammar specification with ANTLR4
- Comprehensive DDD documentation
- Test specifications and traceability matrices
- Implementation-ready documentation"

git push origin v1.0.0
```

Then on GitHub:
1. Go to "Releases" tab
2. Click "Create a new release"
3. Choose the tag v1.0.0
4. Add release title: "Rules Engine PRD v1.0.0 - Complete Implementation"
5. Add release notes (copy from tag message)
6. Click "Publish release"

## Step 6: Set Up Repository Protection (Recommended)

For collaborative work, set up branch protection:

1. Go to Settings > Branches
2. Click "Add rule"
3. Branch name pattern: `main`
4. Enable:
   - ✅ Require a pull request before merging
   - ✅ Require status checks to pass before merging
   - ✅ Require conversation resolution before merging
   - ✅ Include administrators

## Step 7: Create Issues Templates (Optional)

Create `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` directory with templates:

```bash
mkdir -p .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE
```

### Feature Request Template
Create `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md`:

```markdown
---
name: Feature Request
about: Suggest a new feature for the Rules Engine PRD
title: '[FEATURE] '
labels: enhancement
assignees: ''
---

## Feature Description
A clear and concise description of the feature you'd like to see added.

## Bounded Context
Which bounded context does this feature relate to?
- [ ] Coupons
- [ ] Loyalty
- [ ] Promotions
- [ ] Payments
- [ ] Taxes & Fees
- [ ] Core Engine
- [ ] Other (specify)

## Business Value
Describe the business value and expected outcomes.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2
- [ ] Criterion 3

## Additional Context
Add any other context, mockups, or examples about the feature request.
```

### Documentation Update Template
Create `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/documentation.md`:

```markdown
---
name: Documentation Update
about: Suggest improvements to the PRD documentation
title: '[DOCS] '
labels: documentation
assignees: ''
---

## Documentation Section
Which section needs to be updated?

## Current Issue
What's wrong or missing in the current documentation?

## Proposed Changes
What changes do you suggest?

## Impact
How will this improve the documentation quality?
```

## Step 8: Verify Repository Structure

Your final repository structure should look like:

```
rules-engine-prd/
├── .github/
│   └── ISSUE_TEMPLATE/
├── rules-engine-structured-prd/    # Main PRD content
├── .gitignore
├── README.md
├── LICENSE
├── GITHUB_SETUP.md                 # This file
└── CONTRIBUTING.md                  # (Optional)
```

## Commands Summary

Here's the complete command sequence:

```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd /Users/juanpablolazaroalonso/SW/ENGINE-RULES-SP

# Initialize and commit
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Complete Rules Engine PRD with DDD implementation"

# Create repository on GitHub (web interface or gh CLI)
# Then connect:
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/rules-engine-prd.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

# Create release
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release v1.0.0: Complete Rules Engine PRD"
git push origin v1.0.0
```

## Next Steps

1. **Review and customize** this setup guide for your specific needs
2. **Invite collaborators** if this is a team project
3. **Set up project boards** for tracking implementation progress
4. **Create wiki pages** for additional documentation if needed
5. **Set up automated workflows** with GitHub Actions (optional)

Your Rules Engine PRD is now ready for collaborative development and implementation!
